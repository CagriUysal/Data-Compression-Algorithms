# Data-Compression-Algorithms

Following data compression algorithms used to compress a sample text file:

- Binary Huffman
- Ternary Huffman
- Arithmetic
- LZ coding

Run compare_algorithms.m to take results of each compression algorithm (# of bits before and after compression) and see
the compression rates in a graph,
or run the funtions individually if you want specific algorithm's result.

I used a sample text from The Count of Monte Cristo, chapter 19.
